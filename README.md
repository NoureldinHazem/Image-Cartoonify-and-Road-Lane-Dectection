Part 1 :  Applying Image Processing Filters For Image Cartoonifying
<br><br>
Problem Statement:</br>
In this part of the assignment we want to make the real-world images look like they are genuinely from a cartoon. The basic idea is to fill the flat parts with some color and then draw thick lines on the strong edges. In other words, the flat areas should become much more flat and the edges should become much more distinct. We will detect edges and smooth the flat areas, then draw enhanced edges back on top to produce a cartoon or comic book effect.</br></br>

Steps done in this Part:
1.  Generating a black-and-white sketch
2.  Noise Reduction Using Median Filter
3. Edge Detection Using Laplacian Filter
4. Generating a color painting and a cartoon

Part 2 : Road Lane Detection Using Hough Transform
<br><br>
Problem Statement:</br>
The objective of this part of the assignment is the detection of road lanes in an image using Hough Transform.<br><br>

Steps done in this Part: (Hough Transform)
1. Smoothing the image
2. Edge Detection
3. Region Of Interest
4.Accumulation into (ρ, θ)-space using Hough transform
5. Refining Coordinates and HT Post-Processing
